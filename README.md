## Hi, I'm Guilherme 👋

I'm a Software Engineer focused on cloud engineering. My background is centered on understanding systems from first principles and designing scalable, reliable, and well-structured infrastructures.

My technical interests revolve around Kubernetes, AWS, and infrastructure as code with Terraform, as well as backend systems and platform architecture. I value clear documentation, maintainable designs, and well-defined system boundaries.

I’m particularly interested in infrastructure design and in continuously improving how software is structured, deployed, and operated.
